I like reading in relatively undirected ways. The practice is surprisingly fruitful and I'd like to record my metabolized thoughts in some form; maybe even turn them into direction. I have no purpose here other than to write, nothing in mind beyond « il faut cultiver son jardin », but maybe the exercise will prove to be of some interest to others. You can write to me at aplonis@protonmail.com or [find me on twitter](https://www.twitter.com/por_ous).
