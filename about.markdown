Hi! I'm a graduate student living in Montreal. This is basically just a reading blog born out of a need to synthesize and maybe speculate a little. I have some sort of conviction that no topic is too trivial to consider or too abstract to approach, but to give the exercise some kind of structure I'll title each post with the name of a single concept that I want to better illuminate. If you want to get in touch you can email me: voidfraction [at] protonmail [dot] com.
