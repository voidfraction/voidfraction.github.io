Hi! This is something like a reading journal. I'm a graduate student studying ecology and environmental modeling. In my free time I mostly read and I want to keep track of some of that. I'm thinking of making series of posts based on focal ideas rather than texts. I'm not trying to summarize or review things, I mostly want to contextualize and maybe speculate a little. We'll see how it goes.

I'm no expert on most things, feedback is welcome. You can email me: voidfraction [at] proton [dot] me.
