Hi! I'm a graduate student living in Montreal. This is a blog born out of a need to synthesize and maybe speculate a little on things I'm reading or otherwise learning about. I have a conviction that no topic is too trivial to consider or too abstract to approach, but to give the exercise some kind of structure I'll title each post with the name of a single concept that I want to better illuminate for myself and (hopefully) others. If you want to get in touch you can email me: voidfraction [at] proton [dot] me.
