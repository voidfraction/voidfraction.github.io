Hi! I'm a graduate student living in Montreal. I'm using this blog to think out loud about and digest things (primarily books) that I encounter while trying to clarify my concepts. I hope it will be of some interest to others. If you want to get in touch you can email me: aplonis [at] protonmail [dot] com.
