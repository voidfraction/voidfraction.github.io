Hi! This is essentially a reading blog. For the sake of disclosure and context, I'm a graduate student studying spatial statistics and environmental modeling, but in my free time I tend to follow my curiosity more freely. I want to keep track of this process somewhat here. I'm no expert on most things, and feedback is always welcome. You can email me: voidfraction [at] proton [dot] me.
