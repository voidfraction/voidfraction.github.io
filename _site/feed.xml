<p>Previously I circled around the actual content of the book so I’ll try to make inroads now. To start with, I was struck by the authors’ description of the predicament the modern cognitive scientist is in.</p>

<p>This (idealized) scientist is conveyed, by their work, into a specific kind of nihilism: knowing that an idea they cherish isn’t viable but being unable to give it up. This idea could be named the self, the subject, whatever you want; what it boils down to is a persistent, unified entity that frames the flow of moment-to-moment experience. The scientist comes to understand that they can’t practically observe anything like a singular self in the lab or the field; many are quoted in the book saying as much. Something I came across incidentally that exemplifies this is neuroscientist VS Ramachandran’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8574712-the-tell-tale-brain">2010 book</a> that splits the notion of the self into 7 aspects<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, <em>each of which can be disrupted by a specific neurological condition</em>. The notion of a self may fall apart easily under scientific scrutiny, but this goes against the scientist’s own ongoing <em>experience</em> of selfhood. Their everyday life is still suffused with a sense of self and everything it brings, from narcissism and self-pity to the fear of death. The scientist’s predicament, to paraphrase, is that the neuro-cognitive-whatever paradigm they’re beholden to fails a basic test: it doesn’t produce any insight into the daily churn of their own suffering, into <em>dukkha</em><sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Francisco Varela, after losing the world he knew to Pinochet’s regime, learned a different approach to suffering from his Tibetan teachers: the practice and study of meditation. Everyone’s heard the pitch: as a meditator’s practice matures, they start noticing the unhelpful thoughts that spontaneously arise and multiply. They start to see that a lot of their everyday suffering comes from these streams of thought. Over time, as this understanding takes root, a critical distance from one’s own thoughts opens up, destabilizing the naive sense of self. However, none of this is unique to Buddhism: anyone can go down this path through sustained reflection (e.g., the authors note parallels with David Hume’s skeptical attitude). What the Buddhist textual tradition provides in this context is millennia of discourse <em>about</em> meditation and the questions it raises. For simplicity’s sake, we can set aside most of this accumulation for a moment and just look at one point that’s already present in the earliest texts.</p>

<p>The early suttas attributed to the Buddha set two ideas in opposition: a constant, unbounded self, or no self at all. This dichotomy is the essence of the scientist’s predicament above, which makes it convenient that the Buddha’s own teaching (famously “the middle way”) is that it’s a false one. In the Buddha’s world (a newly urbanizing Gangetic plain c. 500 BCE) this discussion of course had a different context: the nature of karma, quite literally ‘action’, was at stake. If it’s true that you face the consequences of your current actions in the future, you have to first of all <em>persist</em> into said future, and persist all the more if the consequences belong to a future rebirth. Brahminical thought had codified this persistence in the centuries before the Buddha, exalting the eternal soul (ātman) and the causal efficacy of action (notably, the emphasis there was on ritual action). Ascetic contemporaries of the Buddha developed a negation of this: deeds (ritual or otherwise) have no constant doer behind them gaining any karmic merit or demerit, and all that happens after death is the physical decomposition of the body<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. These two points of view have important consequences if we’re after insight into suffering. If we have persistent selves, we can do something now that makes us suffer later, and by extension we can prevent this suffering by acting differently. If we don’t have a persistent self, if each instant stands alone, this isn’t possible. The ephemeral instant of suffering comes about due to external causes beyond our control, we are ruled absolutely by fate.</p>

<p>The Buddhist intervention here is simple: the arising of suffering can be understood without presuming a persistent self or the lack thereof. What opens up this middle way is analysing <em>the experience</em> of suffering, as it arises and passes, through a mix of meditation and reasoning. This leads to a recognition of the <em>regularities</em> of the experience each time it arises. For example: suffering never arises without a concurrent <strong>craving</strong><sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, a desire to possess something we lack or be rid of something we have. This ‘craving’ is not a philosophical concept to wrap your head around, it’s a name for something you <em>directly perceive</em> as a correlate of suffering. It’s a flavour of mental activity that you learn to identify. This and other experiential regularities<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> shed light on suffering, opening up the possibility of avoiding it, without bringing up the notion of a self.</p>

<p>If that seems like a bit of an excursion, the authors’ relevant claim is that the careful ‘distillation’ of these experiential regularities is precisely what constitutes science. Their description of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/221963a0">this early experiment</a> was illuminating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bach-y-Rita has designed a video camera for blind persons that can stimulate multiple points in the skin by electrically activated vibration. Using this technique, images formed with the camera were made to correspond to patterns of skin stimulation, thereby substituting for the visual loss. Patterns projected on to the skin have no “visual” content unless the individual is behaviorally active by directing the video camera using head, hand, or body movements. When the blind person does actively behave in this way, after a few hours of experience a remarkable emergence takes place: the person no longer inteprets the skin sensations as body related but as images projected into the space being explored by the bodily directed “gaze” of the video camera. Thus to experience “real objects out there,” the person must actively direct the camera (by head or hand).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s helpful to go back to the idea of the mind as a computer: circuits processing sensory input to produce behavioral output. What stands out from the passage above is a sense that experience is not based on pre-given “sensory input”; the same stimulations can produce radically different experiences. It’s also not based on a given configuration of the “circuit”; the shift happens over hours, too short for neurological change. What does change is the person’s ability to <em>interact with</em> the camera, to start a feedback loop between behavior and sensation, which eventually enables them to experience the same stimuli in a qualitatively different way.</p>

<p>In a striking echo of the Buddha’s logic about suffering, the emergence of projected images in space was neither something that happened <em>to</em> the person nor something the person did. What happened can’t be explained without recourse to something like a <em>history of embodied interaction</em><sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>, a sustained sensorimotor exploration that reveals congruences between patterns of stimulation and one’s own behavior. This is also exactly how a meditator comes to see the relation between craving and suffering through practice guided by tradition. There is no sharp line between this sort of practice and ‘science’ as usually conceived. In both cases the world makes its regularities present to us, but <em>only</em> through our own active engagement with it. Our imagined cognitive scientist’s predicament is that they live a dual disempowerment: they concede their inner lives to the narratives of the ego, and their study systems to an unquestioned computational metaphor. The authors seem to suggest that the way out of this disempowerment is to adopt an even more adventurous form of empiricism, an inquiry that begins with the <em>how</em> of one’s own embodied experience.</p>

<hr />

<p>The basic program of embodied cognition seems to have been taken up quite enthusiastically by many scholars across fields since <em>The Embodied Mind</em> was published in 1992, often as a direct result. I want to look at this side of things more next time and hopefully wrap up my thoughts about this one book so I can move on to other things. I’ve been reading a lot more and faster than I’ve been writing, but that’s probably the right balance.</p>

<p>There’s a contemporary viewpoint that the mind is like a computer: an information processor. I think this is a forgivable metaphor, but it’s a very limited one. I’ve been interested in specific critiques of it and one concept I’ve seen a lot in that context is ‘embodiment’. It’s intuitive to think that the mind is unlike a computer precisely because it’s inseparable from a living body. But this could be dismissed as a romantic idea; maybe all it’s doing is equating ‘mind’ and ‘life’, which doesn’t really illuminate anything. Is there a better path? <em>The Embodied Mind</em> hints at one, but the real reason I decided to read it was one of the three authors: Francisco Varela.</p>

<p>Varela was born and raised in Chile and finished his PhD at Harvard in 1970, studying the insect eye. Just days after he returned to Santiago, a broad left-wing political coalition came to power in Chile with the election of Salvador Allende as president. Varela was a supporter of this project. He was part of a milieu where new ideas about democratic control of the economy were being proposed and tested, and where engineers and doctors were being put in touch with mass organization. The national economy, conceptually freed a little from the anonymous demands of the free market, was being re-understood and experimented with. While reckoning with this, Varela and mentor Humberto Maturana also went about their humble research program of defining life, a task that led them to the notion of <em>autopoiesis</em><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Even the most primitive living cell, at a high level of abstraction, is sort of like a national economy: a set of processes unified by (i) reproducing one another as a whole through time and (ii) maintaining (or trying to maintain) the material conditions that allow for this reproduction.</p>

<p>In 1973, as we know, this period of intellectual and political optimism was ended by a US-backed military coup that led to Augusto Pinochet’s regime. Varela was deeply affected by the coup and lost friends and colleagues to the brutality of the police state, but managed to escape with his family to the US. In 1974 he met a Tibetan Buddhist monk, Chögyam Trungpa, and reportedly talked to him about his inability to come to terms with his situation<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Evidently, the connection that ensued and Varela’s subsequent study and practice of meditation made a profound impact. <em>The Embodied Mind</em> is in large part an effort to reconcile insights from this encounter with open questions in the Western style of cognitive science Varela trained in, and ultimately to sketch a new view of the mind called <strong>enactivism</strong>.</p>

<p>To get to enactivism, we need to understand what it was a response to<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, i.e. what the authors calls <strong>cognitivism</strong>, and why <em>that</em> mode of thinking arose in the first place. Cognitivism, roughly the idea of the abstract information-processing mind, took hold at institutions like Harvard (notably, in that case, through Noam Chomsky) in the 1950s and 60s. Behavioral science preceding this tended to see behavior as a reflex of past conditioning (think Pavlov’s dogs), which left the present-tense mental process of the animal external to scientific understanding. However, developments in other fields provided a way to talk about this process: cryptographic advances necessitated by the Second World War had led to Claude Shannon’s mathematical theory of information, and in 1952 the first study of neural activity to model them as electrical circuits was published<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. The pieces were in place for the emergence of cognitivism as a <em>model</em> of mind: a cognitive process is understandable as a <em>computation performed by neural circuits on incoming sensory information</em>. Thought as the manipulation of symbols according to rules, the brain as a computer: slight caricatures of the position, but not unfair ones.</p>

<p>This model was wrong, as they all are, but it was undoubtedly useful. Given the right experimental constraints, this actually is what some mental processes are like on some level. However, through its utility the model became ingrained for some scientists as the automatic, unquestioned image of what the mind <em>is</em>. This line of thinking quickly runs into a wall: we may be able to understand the reaction an anesthetized brain has to some simple stimulus (a green circle, a loud tone) in these terms, but this tells us little about what the <em>animal</em> would do in any natural context. Even the decisionmaking of a fly evading a swatter (Varela’s dissertation) is far too complex to be understood through these means. Instead of the two-way behaviorist split between behavior and an unknowable mind, the cognitivists ran into a three-way split between behavior, a formal model of cognition, and what had to now be passed over in silence: the organism’s actual experience. Varela came to understand the systematic practice of meditation (along with the relevant textual traditions) as a type of <strong>first-person science</strong>, with experience as its object. This was an insight that was new to me and felt like the central piece of the book. The threads of Tibetan Buddhist tradition and midcentury Harvard neuroscience are brought together here<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>, and despite the various reactionary tendencies of both I think they end up producing something interesting. I’ll leave it there for the moment, and try to actually talk about the impasse next time. Here’s Varela from a posthumously published interview.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I do not care whether people practice Buddhist meditation or not. Nor am I advocating a combination of Eastern and Western thinking of whatever kind; my goal is quite simply and clearly to perform successful research.</p>
