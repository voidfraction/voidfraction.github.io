<p><strong>Book</strong>: <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262720212/the-embodied-mind/">The Embodied Mind (Varela, Rosch, and Thompson, 1992)</a></p>

<p>The mind is not an information processor. Chilean biologist Francisco Varela saw this clearly several decades ago. Reading <em>The Embodied Mind</em> was refreshing because I came to share Varela’s clarity at times, but it also left me with a lot of questions. What follows is a mix of reflection and context.</p>

<p>Varela, born and raised in Chile, finished his PhD in biology at Harvard in 1970, studying <em>information processing</em> in the insect visual system. Only days after he returned from Harvard, and in a first for Latin America, the Chilean people elected a Marxist, Salvador Allende, to the office of president. Varela was a staunch supporter of Salvador Allende and a prominent member of an intellectual milieu where new ideas for democratic control of the economy along scientific principles were being proposed and tested. The national economy, conceptually freed a little from the anonymous demands of “the market,” was being re-understood and experimented with. While reckoning with this new world, Varela and mentor Humberto Maturana also went about the humble research program of defining life itself, a task that led them to the notion of <strong>autopoiesis</strong><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Even the most primitive living cell, at a high level of abstraction, is, maybe, analogous to a national economy: a set of processes (chemical in the one, social in the other) unified by (i) reproducing one another as a whole through time and (ii) maintaining the material conditions that allow for this reproduction.</p>

<p>In 1973, however, this period of intellectual and political optimism was ended by a US-backed military coup that led to Augusto Pinochet seizing power. Varela was deeply affected by the coup and lost friends and colleagues to the brutal machine of Pinochet’s police state, but managed to escape with his family to the US. Later in the 70s, probably not without reason, Varela delved into the practice of Buddhist meditation, finding teachers in the first wave of Tibetan monks to flee from the People’s Liberation Army in Tibet to practice in the West<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. <em>The Embodied Mind</em> is in large part an effort to reconcile insights from the Buddhist tradition and the practice of meditation with open questions in Western cognitive science, and to sketch a new view of the mind (“enactivism”).</p>

<p>To get to enactivism, we need to understand what it was a response to, i.e. what Varela calls “cognitivism”, and why <em>that</em> mode of thinking arose in the first place. Cognitivism, or, roughly, the idea of the information-processing mind, took hold in scientific circles by the 60s (through figures like Chomsky) for perfectly clear reasons. Preceding behavioral science tended to see behavior as being determined fully by past conditioning (e.g. think Pavlov’s dogs), which had the obvious shortcoming of leaving the present-tense experience of any animal external to scientific understanding. However, the nascent fields of neuroscience and computing provided for a way to talk about this experience in scientific language: cryptographic advances necessitated by the Second World War had led to the first mathematical theory of information, and in 1952 the first model of neural activity in terms of electrical circuits had been validated (on the very long and thus experimentally tractable neurons of the giant squid). All the pieces were in place for the emergence of cognitivism as a paradigm, a <strong>model</strong> of experience, a way to specify its content: the cognitive process is <em>computation performed by neural circuits on sensory information</em>. Thought as the manipulation of symbols according to rules, and the brain as a computer.</p>

<p>This model may have been wrong but it was undoubtedly useful, and through its utility became ingrained for some scientists as the automatic, unquestioned image of what the mind <em>is</em>. Ultimately, however, this type of description is mainly suited to understanding simple mental processes in highly idealized situations. We may be able to fully understand the reaction a heavily anesthetized brain has to some single stimulus (a green circle, a single musical note, an angry face), but our everyday experience of life seems to be much more than a simple sum of such stimuli and responses. Instead of a two-way split between behavior and an unknowable mind, we now have a three-way split between behavior, computational model of cognition, and unknowable experience.</p>

<p>Varela’s “enactive” approach responded to this impasse by thinking the problem through with categories from the Buddhist tradition. Varela understood the systematic practice of meditation and the associated textual &amp; pedagogic traditions to constitute a type of <em>first-person science</em>, with experience as its object. This was an insight that was new to me and felt like the central piece of the book. In the global history of intellectual exchange, this episode strikes me as particularly interesting: it brings together the threads of Tibetan Buddhist tradition, Marxist political action in Chile, Western phenomenology, and midcentury Harvard<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> neuroscience in the figure of Francisco Varela. It’s fascinating to note that often what is a novelty to abstract science has already been made manifest in our practices, in the mundane repetitions of everyday life. Buddhist meditation is one such practice, one that has been extensively elaborated and written about across a 2,500 year tradition (though I should say, I don’t think the Buddhists have an exclusive claim on repetitive, systematic introspection!). Although I’m still groping toward a sense of Varela’s true relevance today, it’s clear he made an honest attempt at synthesizing these threads. I’ll leave it here for now but I intend to process the actual thought of the book a bit more in the next post.</p>

      <p>Developed mainly in <em>Autopoiesis and Cognition</em> (1972), which I plan on reading at some point as well. While <em>The Embodied Mind</em> was written two decades later, and the concept of autopoiesis isn’t central to the book, it’s an elaboration of the same worldview and I hope to work out in the next post how they cohere. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
