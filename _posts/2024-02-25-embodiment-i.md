[The Embodied Mind (Varela, Rosch, and Thompson, 1992)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262720212/the-embodied-mind/)

There's a contemporary viewpoint that the mind is like a computer: an information processor. I think this is a forgivable metaphor, but it's a very limited one. Recently I've been interested in specific critiques of it and one concept I've seen a lot in that context is "embodiment". It's intuitive to think that the mind is unlike a computer precisely because it's inseparable from a living body. But this could be dismissed as a romantic idea; maybe all it's doing is equating 'mind' and 'life', which doesn't really illuminate anything. Is there a better path? *The Embodied Mind* hints at one, but the real reason I decided to read it was one of the three authors: Francisco Varela. I think it's worth going on a brief biographical detour.

Varela was born and raised in Chile and finished his PhD at Harvard in 1970, studying, well, *information processing* in the insect visual system. Just days after he returned to Santiago, Salvador Allende was elected president as the leader of a broad left-wing political coalition. Varela was a supporter of Allende and part of a milieu where new ideas about democratic control of the economy were being proposed and tested. The national economy, conceptually freed a little from the anonymous demands of the free market, was being re-understood and experimented with. While reckoning with this, Varela and mentor Humberto Maturana also went about their humble research program of defining life, a task that led them to the notion of *autopoiesis*[^1]. Even the most primitive living cell, at a high level of abstraction, is sort of like a national economy: a set of processes (chemical in the one, social in the other) unified by (i) reproducing one another as a whole through time and (ii) maintaining (or trying to maintain) the material conditions that allow for this reproduction. This was a promising line of thought.

In 1973, this period of intellectual and political optimism was ended by a US-backed military coup that led to Pinochet seizing power. Varela was deeply affected by the coup and lost friends and colleagues to the brutality of Pinochet's police state, but managed to escape with his family to the US. Later in the 70s he took up the practice of Buddhist meditation, finding teachers in the first wave of Tibetan monks to flee from the People's Liberation Army in Tibet to practice in the West[^2]. This made an impact on Varela. *The Embodied Mind* is in large part an effort to reconcile insights from this encounter with open questions in the Western style of cognitive science Varela trained in, and ultimately to sketch a new view of the mind called **enactivism**.

To get to enactivism, we need to understand what it was a response to[^3], i.e. what the authors calls **cognitivism**, and why *that* mode of thinking arose in the first place. Cognitivism, roughly the idea of the abstract information-processing mind, took hold at institutions like Harvard (notably, in that case, through Noam Chomsky) in the 1950s and 60s. Behavioral science preceding this tended to see behavior as a reflex of past conditioning (think Pavlov's dogs), which left the present-tense mental process of the animal external to scientific understanding. However, developments in other fields provided a way to talk about this process: cryptographic advances necessitated by the Second World War had led to Claude Shannon's mathematical theory of information, and in 1952 the first study of neural activity to model them as electrical circuits was published[^4]. The pieces were in place for the emergence of cognitivism as a *model* of mind: a cognitive process is understandable as a *computation performed by neural circuits on incoming sensory information*. Thought as the manipulation of symbols according to rules, the brain as a computer: slight caricatures of the position, but not unfair ones.

This model was wrong, as they all are, but it was undoubtedly useful. Given the right experimental constraints, this actually is what some mental processes are like. However, through its utility the model became ingrained for some scientists as the automatic, unquestioned image of what the mind *is*. This line of thinking quickly runs into a wall: we may be able to understand the reaction an anesthetized brain has to some simple stimulus (a green circle, a loud tone) in these terms, but this tells us little about what the *animal* would do in any natural context. Even the decisionmaking of a fly evading a swatter (Varela's example) is far too complex to be understood through these means. Instead of the two-way behaviorist split between behavior and an unknowable mind, the cognitivists ran into a three-way split between behavior, a formal model of cognition, and what had to now be passed over in silence: the organism's actual experience of acting in the world. Varela came to understand the systematic practice of meditation (along with the relevant textual traditions) as a type of **first-person science**, with experience as its object. This was an insight that was new to me and felt like the central piece of the book. The threads of Tibetan Buddhist tradition and midcentury Harvard neuroscience are brought together here[^5], and I think they end up producing something interesting. I'll leave it there for the moment, and try to actually address the impasse next time.

[^1]: I want to look into his earlier work in more depth at some point but I mention this here because I think *The Embodied Mind* is an elaboration of this understanding of autopoiesis.

[^2]: He was even briefly taught by Ch√∂gyam Trungpa, who also taught the likes of David Bowie and Joni Mitchell. Varela also went on to found the [Mind and Life Institute](https://www.mindandlife.org/about/#history) with the Dalai Lama, though what this collaboration really meant is still unclear to me.

[^3]: There is actually an intervening paradigm between cognitivism and enactivism ("emergence") in the book. The idea there is roughly to ground this abstract symbol-processing mind in its biological substance, but the leap from one level to the other, the emergence, is never made fully transparent. It doesn't matter too much right now, I think.

[^5]: It's worth mentioning that the book also engages briefly with European phenomenologists like Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty. Mostly they're used to motivate the idea of systematically understanding experience, not as the actual approach to the problem.
